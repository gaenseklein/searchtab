# searchtab
plugin for micro text editor - searching in one tab

although you can use it its still an early WIP. it includes the functionality but 
the gui is still 1st version and likely to change in the future as i think it would 
be better to separate more between "search/replace" and "search/replace in repository"
and not have them in one place like now. 
that would allow for more advanced options, like 
- black-/whitelist files
- black-/whitelist line-numbers ("replace from line 100 to 200")

so you can use it but expect it to be changed in the future.
